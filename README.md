# March Madness Live Preditcor
This was a project for AP CSP's hackathon and my partner got 1st in every deisgn. There wasn't much work put into the design but it's still semi-decent. This was my first time truly using react and its features so there was a lot of learning especially since I am not a huge fan of Javascript of Web Deisgn in general. We didn't have time to design UI before we stareted so the proportions are quite awful.
